# Battleship Rules

Each player has a 10x10 board on which the player is able to place 5 ships:

* A Carrier, which is 5 tiles long
* A Battleship, which is 4 tiles long
* A Cruiser, which is 3 tiles long
* A Submarine, which is 3 tiles long
* A Destroyer, which is 2 tiles long

Each ship can be placed either horizontally or vertically on the board, and cannot be placed partially off the board.

Each tile is denoted by a coordinate, ```A```-```J``` for columns and ```1```-```10``` for rows

* e.g., the top left corner would be at coordinate ```A1```

Each player then takes turns picking a tile on the opposing playerâ€™s grid, taking a shot at that tile.

* If the tile contains a ship, the shot is a ```HIT```;
* If the tile does not contain a ship, the shot is a ```MISS```

A ship is sunk if all the tiles for that ship have been marked as a ```HIT```. The player must report that a ship was sunk when the last tile of the ship is ```HIT```.

The game ends when one player has sunk all of the opposing players ships.
